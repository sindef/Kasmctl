#Kasmctl

- [ ] Change Request handling so I don't have to pass the url and build a request in every function - maybe a base function to create a request and just send the URL/body to this?

- [ ] Add all relevant functionality from https://kasmweb.com/docs/latest/developers/developer_api.html#get-kasms

- [ ] Add testing for each function
